reasonable password alphabet: 0x20 through 0x7E = 95 values
log2 tells us how many bits are needed to encode that
log2(95) is almost 6,57 bits/char

MD4 digest size: 128 bits
divide that by the bits per character to get the number of characters
=> 128/log2(95) < 19,48 characters

=> MD4 breaks even at 20 characters

note that the UTF-16 encoding doesn't influence this
since every second byte is 0x00 in every value
and this is common to all passwords
